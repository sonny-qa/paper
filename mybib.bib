	abstract = 	 {Abstract This paper presents a new methodology to continuously update and improve fracture network models. We begin with a hypothetical model whose fracture network parameters and geological information are known. After generating the "exact?? fracture network with known characteristics, the data were exported to a reservoir simulator and simulations were run over a period of time. Intelligent wells equipped with downhole multiple pressure and flow sensors were placed throughout the reservoir and put on production. These producers were completed in different fracture zones to create a representative pressure and production response. We then considered a number of wells of which static and dynamic data were used to model well fracture density. When new wells were drilled, historical and new data were used to update the fracture density using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). More dynamic data will be provided as well as more static data when additional wells are drilled. The accuracy of the prediction model depends significantly on the representation of the available data of the existing fracture network. The importance of conventional data and smart data prediction capability was also investigated. A highly sensitive input data was selected through forward selection scheme to train the ANN. Well geometric locations were included as a new link in the ANN regression process. Once the relationship between fracture network parameters and well performance data was established, the ANN model was used to predict fracture density at newly drilled locations. Finally, an error analysis through correlation coefficient and percentage absolute relative error performance was performed to examine the accuracy of the proposed inverse modeling methodology. It was shown that fracture dominated production performance data collected from both conventional and smart wells allow automatically updating the fracture network model. The technique proposed helps in generating another -readily available at no cost- data source for fracture characterization to be used as supplementary to limited 1-D data obtained from well logs and cores. Introduction Naturally fractured reservoirs (NFR) are characterized by their fracture network properties, such as fracture density, orientation, location, dimension, and connectivity. The network properties control the fluid flow in the reservoir and therefore, accurate prediction of those parameters is essential in generating the static model (fracture network) to be used for performance prediction. Several different approaches have been utilized based on statistical, fractal, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods to build a conditioned stochastic fracture network models. Fracture statistics and distribution functions are traditionally extracted from core, well log, outcrop, and seismic data. Intelligent fields in which reservoir surveillance data are continually measured using permanently installed downhole completion devices have been increasingly becoming popular. Multiphase production data are transmitted to engineers to monitor field operation and make effective decisions. The readily available conventional and smart well production information, referred to as dynamic data, could be also useful in generating static models of NFRs. In our previous attempt, we showed that there exists a non-linear relationship between dynamic data and fracture network characteristics (Al-Anazi and Babadagli, 2007). In that study, ANN was used to detect the underlying relationship. Our inverse problem consists of predicting fracture network characteristics using limited static and readily available historical well performance (dynamic) data. The solution of such an inverse problem is ill-posed in general and cannot uniquely constrain the detailed variations in reservoir static properties. The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of smart (permanent downhole devices) and conventional (well surface devices) dynamic data in generating the fracture network maps.},
